## Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms

#### Badge

In an online learning context, a badge (also referred to as a digital badge) is a digital record of academic achievement, often shaped like a traditional badge, which denotes the completion of an educational program, course, or exercise by a student. Badges are designed to be shared, and may also support being embedded into other pages.

A certification is a record, typically in the form of a document, of being declared (certified) as competent in a particular act, or skillset.

However, some organizations will also provide a complete non-formal educational program to prepare students first. Some professions require certification, meaning the professional must hold certain certifications, by law, to perform that work. The term certificate is sometimes used interchangeably with certification, but certificates do not expire, as they are record of academic accomplishemnt. A certification does expire, after a set amount of time, because issuers are generally not comfortable vouching one's abilities indefinitely. Instead, renewals are used.

In Canada, most job applications expect a resume, but C.V.s are used in some very specific instances.
